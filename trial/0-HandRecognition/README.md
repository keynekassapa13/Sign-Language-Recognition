# Experiment - Hand Recognition

Basic experiment to implement hand recognition to compare timing/speed with another 
implementation from 0-OpenCVIntegration.

This experimental attempt is  based on the tutorial from: https://gogul09.github.io/software/hand-gesture-recognition-p1
Author of tutorial: Gogul

Note - excuse the mess of a class, this is just a rough implementation
